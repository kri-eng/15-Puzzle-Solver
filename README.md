# 15-Puzzle-Solver

This project is an AI-powered Python program that solves any configuration of the 15-puzzle. The AI agent uses multiple search algorithms like A*, IDA*, Iterative Deepening Search, and BFS to search for a solution, while heuristics such as Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance optimize the process.

## Overview
The 15-puzzle is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 4x4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them, one at a time, into the empty space until they are in order, with the empty space at the bottom-right corner.

This project implements AI agents that explore different ways to solve the puzzle using advanced search algorithms and heuristic optimization techniques.

## Features
AI Search Algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- A* Search (A*)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*)

Heuristics:
- Manhattan Distance
- Euclidean Distance
  
Flexible Solver: Supports any 15-puzzle configuration as input.

Optimized Search: Uses advanced techniques to minimize the number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
